MediaTek GCE
===============

This is temporary node for cmdq driver legacy interface, which compatible
with legacy display driver. CMDQ SVP send commands and secure metadata to
secure world cmdq driver, which control gce hardware in trustzone.

CMDQ svp driver uses mailbox framework for communication. Please refer to
mailbox.txt for generic information about mailbox device-tree bindings.

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "mediatek,cmdq-svp"
- reg: Address range of the GCE unit
- interrupts: The interrupt signal from the GCE block
- clock: Clocks according to the common clock binding
- clock-names: Must be "GCE" to stand for GCE clock

Example:

	cmdq-svp: cmdq-svp@10212000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,cmdq-svp";
		reg = <0 0x10212000 0 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 135 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		clocks = <&infracfg_ao INFRACFG_AO_GCE_CG>;
		clock-names = "GCE";
	};
