= Mediatek MT6359 PMIC eFuse device tree bindings =

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be
	"mediatek,mt6359-efuse": for MT6359 PMIC
- #address-cells: should be <1>
- #size-cells: should be <1>

= Data cells =
Are child nodes of PMIC eFuse, bindings of which as described in
bindings/nvmem/nvmem.txt

Example:

	pmic_efuse: efuse {
		compatible = "mt6359-efuse";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;

		/* Data cells */
		accdet_cali: accdet_cali@10 {
			reg = <0x66 0x2>;
		};
	};

= Data consumers =
Are device nodes which consume nvmem data cells or nvmem device directly.

Example:

	thermal {
		...
		nvmem = <&pmic_efuse>;
		nvmem-names = "pmic_efuse_device";
	};

	accdet {
		...
		nvmem-cells = <&accdet_cali>;
		nvmem-cell-names = "calibration";
	};
