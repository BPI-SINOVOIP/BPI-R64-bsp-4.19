	depends on ARCH_MEDIATEK || COMPILE_TEST
	select MAILBOX
	select MTK_CMDQ_MBOX
	select MTK_INFRACFG
	help
	  Say yes here to add support for the MediaTek Command Queue (CMDQ)
	  driver. The CMDQ is used to help read/write registers with critical
	  time limitation, such as updating display configuration during the
	  vblank.

config MTK_INFRACFG
	bool "MediaTek INFRACFG Support"
	select REGMAP
	help
	  Say yes here to add support for the MediaTek INFRACFG controller. The
	  INFRACFG controller contains various infrastructure registers not
	  directly associated to any device.

config MTK_DVFSRC
	bool "MediaTek DVFSRC Support"
	depends on ARCH_MEDIATEK
	default ARCH_MEDIATEK
	help
	  Say yes here to add support for the MediaTek DVFSRC (dynamic voltage
	  and frequency scaling resource collector) found
	  on different MediaTek SoCs. The DVFSRC is a proprietary
	  hardware which is used to collect all the requests from
	  system and turn into the decision of minimum Vcore voltage
	  and minimum DRAM frequency to fulfill those requests.

config MTK_PMIC_WRAP
	tristate "MediaTek PMIC Wrapper Support"
	select RESET_CONTROLLER
	select REGMAP
	help
	  Say yes here to add support for MediaTek PMIC Wrapper found
	  on different MediaTek SoCs. The PMIC wrapper is a proprietary
	  hardware to connect the PMIC.

	bool "MediaTek SCPSYS Support"
	default ARCH_MEDIATEK
	select REGMAP
	select MTK_INFRACFG
	select PM_GENERIC_DOMAINS if PM
	help
	  Say yes here to add support for the MediaTek SCPSYS power domain
	  driver.

config MTK_SCPSYS_BRINGUP
	bool "MediaTek SCPSYS bring Up Support"
	depends on MTK_SCPSYS
	help
	  Say yes here to support for MediaTek SCPSYS power domain power on
	  for chip bring up early stage.
	  This driver is used to turn on the specific power domain for chip
	  bringing up stage.

config MTK_MMDVFS
	tristate "MediaTek MMDVFS Support"
	depends on ARCH_MEDIATEK || COMPILE_TEST
	select REGULATOR_MTK_DVFSRC
	help
	  Say yes here to add support for the MediaTek Multimedia DVFS (MMDVFS)
	  driver. The MMDVFS is used to set clk for Mediatek multimedia hardwares
	  , such as display, camera, mdp and video codec. Say no if your device
	  does not need to do DVFS for Multimedia hardwares.
