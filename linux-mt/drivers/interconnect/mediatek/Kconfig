	  This is a driver for the Mediatek Network-on-Chip
	  with DVFSRC-based platforms.
	  The Mediatek EMI(external memory interface) Interconnect driver
	  will aggregate require EMI BW of users to DVFSRC(dynamic voltage
	  and frequency scaling resource collector). The DVFSRC will adjust
	  appropriate DRAM frequency to fulfill this bandwidth request.
